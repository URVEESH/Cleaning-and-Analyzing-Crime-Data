In this project, " Cleaning and Analyzing Crime Data" I did an in-depth investigation of a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2020 to the present, focusing on real-world crime occurrences. My objectives center on uncovering meaningful insights and patterns within this dataset, which can inform decision-making, influence policy formulation, and enhance proactive law enforcement strategies. My analysis commences with the careful acquisition and thorough inspection of the dataset, addressing data types, missing values, duplicates, and data quality issues. By the end of the data cleaning phase, I have a refined dataset that serves as the foundation for exploratory data analysis. 

In the heart of analysis lies the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase, where I explored a multitude of aspects related to crime data: 

Overall Crime Trends: I examined the long-term trends in crime rates over the years, offering a view of how crime has evolved from 2020 to the present. 

Seasonal Patterns: Analysis uncovers potential seasonal variations in crime data, with insights into which months exhibit the most significant fluctuations. 

Most Common Crime Type: Identifying the most frequent type of crime is crucial for law enforcement, guiding their strategic planning and resource allocation. 

Regional Differences: I segmented the data by region or city to illuminate variations in crime rates, allowing for more effective localized approaches to crime prevention. 

Correlation with Economic Factors: My efforts extend to incorporating economic data for the same period, engaging in statistical analysis to identify potential correlations between socioeconomic factors and crime rates. 

Day-of-the-Week Analysis: By grouping data by the day of the week, I gained insight into variations in crime frequencies, which can guide the allocation of resources and interventions. 

Impact of Major Events: I explored how specific dates affect crime rates, examining changes occurring 30 days before and after each event to understand their implications.
